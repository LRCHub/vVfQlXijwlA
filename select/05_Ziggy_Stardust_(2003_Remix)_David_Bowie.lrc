[00:25.83] Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
[00:32.59] And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
[00:38.27] But made it too far
[00:41.85] Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band
[01:06.35] 
[00:49.59] Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
[00:56.43] Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
[01:02.17] He could leave 'em to hang
[01:06.06] 'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan
[01:32.06] 
[01:13.25] So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
[01:24.73] With just the beer light to guide us
[01:29.75] So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?
[02:02.25] 
[01:48.84] Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
[01:55.40] The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
[02:01.16] With God given ass
[02:05.07] He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar
[02:30.57] 
[02:12.21] Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
[02:24.38] Like a leper messiah
[02:28.75] When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.
