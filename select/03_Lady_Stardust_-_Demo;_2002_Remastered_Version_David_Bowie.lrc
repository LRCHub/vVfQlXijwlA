[00:14.12] People stared at the makeup on his face
[00:20.23] Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
[00:29.04] The boy in the bright blue jeans
[00:33.38] Jumped up on the stage
[00:36.64] And lady stardust sang his songs
[00:40.38] Of darkness and disgrace
[00:52.38] 
[00:44.84] And he was alright, the band was altogether
[00:51.84] Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
[01:00.39] And he was awful nice
[01:04.69] Really quite out of sight
[01:09.05] And he sang all night long
[01:22.05] 
[01:14.24] Femme fatales emerged from shadows
[01:23.01] To watch this creature fair
[01:26.83] Boys stood upon their chairs
[01:30.56] To make their point of view
[01:35.15] I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
[01:41.15] Lady stardust sang his songs
[01:46.70] Of darkness and dismay
[01:57.70] 
[01:50.66] And he was alright, the band was altogether
[01:58.30] Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
[02:06.49] And he was awful nice
[02:10.56] Really quite paradise
[02:14.98] And he sang all night long
[02:27.98] 
[02:22.37] Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name
[02:47.37] 
[02:31.22] And he was alright, the band was altogether
[02:38.52] Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
[02:47.27] And he was awful nice
[02:51.26] Really quite out of sight
[02:55.64] And he sang all night long
