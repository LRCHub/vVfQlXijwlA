Bobby Boy's full of bravado
His girlfriend looks like Bridgette Bardot
He got drunk and crashed his car
He is such a superstar

He's a supercharged lover
Sold his soul and sold his mother
For rock 'n' roll and fame
Again and again, and again, and again, and again

Bobby Boy wears leather trousers
Look so sexy, they arouse us
Traveled near and traveled far
He is such a superstar

He's a superhuman lover
Loves himself and loves no other
Just rock 'n' roll and fame
Again and again, and again, and again, and again

He's superficial fucker
Has this one and doing other
For rock 'n' roll and fame
Again and again, and again, and again

He's a supercharged lover
Sold his soul and sold his mother
For rock 'n' roll and fame
Again and again, and again, and again

He's a superhuman lover
Loves himself and loves no other
Just rock 'n' roll and fame
Again and again, and again, and again, and again
